# wsuhack
This is the Django API backend for the application my team built for CrimsonCode 2018, a hackathon in WSU, Pullman. 
  
Find the website here: http://newtonify.tsenguun.com/  
  
Requirements:  
- Django  
- DjangoRestFramework  
- Sympy  
  
Clone the repository using:  
$ git clone https://github.com/Utsal20/wsuhack.git  
  
Change working directory to repository:  
$ cd wsuhack  
  
Run the server on localhost:  
$ python3 manage.py runserver  
  
The actual server is hosted in AWS EC2. You can access the instance by using SSL. Google for instructions.  
  
How it works:  
(Will update soon!)
